Projects for my application to UIUC MSFE
-	Markowitz Model Python Project: Portfolio optimization program that implements the Markowitz model. The program generates 10,000 random portfolios using data pulled from Yahoo Finance, calculating expected return, volatility, and Sharpe ratios of each random portfolio. It uses Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) and visualizes the efficient frontier and the optimal portfolio out of the 10,000. This project demonstrates my proficiency in financial analysis, numerical optimization, data handing, and application of modern portfolio theory. 
-	Black-Scholes Profit and Loss Calculation Graph: Developed a Python-based tool to calculate and visualize the price of European call and put options using the Black-Scholes model. Implemented interactive features to input stock price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free rate, and volatility. The tool also generates a profit/loss graph showing potential outcomes based on market movements, providing real-time coordinates for stock price and profit/loss points on the graph. Utilized mplcursors for interactive data visualization. 
-	Monte Carlo Future Stock Price Simulator: a Monte Carlo simulation tool designed to predict the future price of a stock based on historical data from Yahoo Finance. By inputting a stock ticker symbol, the program retrieves one year of daily adjusted closing prices, calculates the stock's average daily return and volatility, and simulates 500 possible price paths over a 252-day period (one trading year). The simulation models the random fluctuations of stock prices using statistical techniques, and the results are visualized with a plot of all price trajectories, highlighting the mean price. The final output provides a prediction of the stockâ€™s price one year from now based on the average of all simulations.
- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): Analyzes the relationship between a specific stock and the broader market over a given period of time. Libraries like numpy, pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib are imported for calculations, data handling, and visualizatons are leveraged to derive meaningful insights into the stock's comparative performance.
